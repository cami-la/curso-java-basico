/* A statistic was made in five Brazilian cities to collect data on traffic accidents. The following data were obtained:

   a) The. City code;
   B. Number of passenger vehicles (in 1999);
   รง. Number of traffic accidents with victims (in 1999). Want to know:
  d. What is the highest and lowest rate of traffic accidents and to which city does it belong;
   and. What is the average number of vehicles in the five cities together;
   f. What is the average of traffic accidents in cities with less than 2,000 passenger vehicles.
